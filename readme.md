Within the possibilities of the engine, I applied the following concepts to test the framework:

- Collision Masks
- Warp Points
- Dialog Boxes
- 4-dir movement
- Map rendering with background image and collision map
- Sprite animation
- ~~Camera system~~

Within the limitations of the framework, everything went relatively well. Unfortunately, I had to cut the camera system because the interpreter was causing a lot of trouble with the logic I applied. It's probably possible to apply it in another way, but... I've already achieved the understanding I needed.

I conclude that although the language is very pleasant for development, PyGame is not well suited for professional uses. I would only use it in an academic environment.
